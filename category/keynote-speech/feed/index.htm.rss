<p> Guoren Wang, Beijing Institute Of Technology<gwmw class="ginger-module-highlighter-mistake-type-3" id="gwmw-15722233625936670522727">,</gwmw>China </p>



<p>Human beings are moving from the IT era to the DT (data technology) era in which data is the most valuable resource. In terms of Big Data computing, the mainstream computing systems of Big Data represented by Hadoop, Spark and Flink have different programming models and interfaces, which focus on batch or stream tasks respectively. With the development of mobile internet, the traditional cloud computing model has been unable to effectively promote the development of new applications such as smart homes and smart cities. Therefore, mixed batch &amp; stream processing, cross-domain deployments and edge computing will be the development and research trends of the future big data computing.<br>In this talk, we will first review the traditional big data computing platforms, and introduce their development history, characteristics, advantages and core issues. We then will analyze the challenges and difficulties faced by the traditional cloud computing models from the aspects of batch &amp; stream interactive computing, cross-data center computing and mobile edge computing. We finally propose the development and research trends for future data computing under the era of Big Data 2.0.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<p>Bio: Guoren Wang is currently a professor at Beijing Institute of Technology, a Yangtze River scholar, a recipient of the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, a member of the expert review team of the Information Science Department of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and a vice chair of the Database Technical Committee of the China Computer Federation. Selected as a national candidate for the National Million Talents Project, awarded the honorary title of “Young and Middle-aged Experts with Outstanding Contributions”; Received a total of 10 provincial and ministerial science and technology awards, including the Second Prize of National Science and Technology Progress Award, the First Prize of Science and Technology Progress of Liaoning Province, the Second Prize of Natural Science of Ministry of Education, and the Second Prize of Nature Science of Liaoning Province. His doctoral students won 2 national outstanding paper nomination awards, 2 outstanding doctoral theses in Liaoning Province, and 1 excellent paper of China Computer Federation; the research field is big data management and analysis; and more than 80 papers has been published in important academic conferences and journals such as SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, VLDB Journal, IEEE Trans. TKDE and IEEE Trans. TPDS.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>In healthcare
domains, large-scale heterogeneous types of data like medical images, vital signs,
electronic health records (EHR), genome, etc., have been collected constantly,
forming the valuable big health data. Broad and deep mining/learning of these big heterogeneous biomedical
data can enable innovative Medical AI applications with rich research lines/challenges
underlying. In this talk, I will introduce recent developments and ongoing
projects on the above topic, especially in intelligent diagnostic decision
support and disease early detection by using various advanced data mining/deep
learning techniques including image analysis (for medical images), multivariate
time-series analysis (for vital signs like ECG/EEG), patterns mining (for EHR),
text mining (for medical notes), sensory analysis (for sensory data like air
pollutants) as well as data fusion methods for integrated modeling. Some
innovative applications on Medical AI with breakthrough results based on the
developed techniques, as well as the underlying challenging issues and open
opportunities, will also be addressed.</p>

<p>Hongzhi Yin, The University of Queensland<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<p>Abstract: The rapid development of mobile Internet, location acquisition and 5G communication technologies has fostered a profusion of geo-social networks (e.g., Foursquare, Yelp and Google Place). They provide users an online platform to check-in at points of interests (e.g., cinemas, galleries and hotels) and share their life experiences in the physical world via mobile devices. The new dimension of location implies extensive knowledge about user behaviours and interests by bridging the gap between online social networks and the physical world. It is crucial to develop new geo-social recommendation services for both individual users and groups to explore the new places, attend new events and find their potential partners to attend these events together. This keynote will introduce three emerging geo-social recommendation paradigms and their new challenges:  spatial item recommendation for mobile users, spatial item recommendation for dynamic groups, and joint spatial item and partner recommendation.  This keynote will also explore how to adopt and advance the network embedding techniques to address the new challenges in the three geo-social recommendation services.  <gwmw style="display:none;"></p>
