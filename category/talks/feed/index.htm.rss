<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Feature engineering is one of the most important parts of machine learning task. As a most universal format of data existence, such as social network, information network etc, information networks have been widely studied within a broad scope of machine learning. Network Representation Learning (NRL) aims to project network nodes (or other entities) into a low-dimensional vector space while preserving general proximity between nodes, and has become a hot topic in data mining and machine learning. In this talk, I will first overview the basic concepts of NRL, and give an introduction about our recent advancements in such field, such as tag embedding, domain adaptive network embedding, and landmark based network embedding etc.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>



<p>With the fast development of various positioning techniques such as Global Position System (GPS), mobile devices and remote sensing, spatio-temporal data generated in urban areas has become increasingly available nowadays. Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important for better design of smart city applications, such as human mobility monitoring, smart transportation, urban planning, public safety, and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution of spatio-temporal datasets increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics-based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed. Recently, with the great success of AI techniques, especially deep learning methods, various AI techniques have been widely applied in analyzing rich spatio-temporal data generated in urban areas. In this tutorial, I will present our recent research on AI empowered spatio-temporal data mining. First, I will introduce the new challenges and opportunities of applying AI techniques to address various spatio-temporal data mining tasks in general. Then I will summarize a general framework to show the pipeline of AI empowered spatio-temporal data mining, followed by several examples illustrating how AI techniques including both shallow models and deep learning models can be utilized in the applications of demand-supply prediction in on-demand services, urban traffic prediction and urban crowd flow prediction. Finally, I will conclude the limitations of current research and point out future research directions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;To achieve satisfying classification performance, traditional machine learning (TML) usually assumes that there are abundant labeled data with i.i.d. distribution to train a good model. However, there always lacks of labeled data and are expensive to annotate data, thus TML may fail. Fortunately, there may exist large amount of labeled data from related source domains but with different distributions. Along this line, Transfer Learning (TL) is proposed to adapt the knowledge from related domain to improving the performance in target domains. In this talk, I will overview the concepts of transfer learning, and recent studies of transfer learning. Then, I will introduce our efforts made on the research on transfer learning algorithms. Finally, some possible future research directions are pointed out.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Graph analytics, especially for the big graphs with billions of nodes and edges, is an exciting new area for big data analytics workloads. It has drawn enormous research interests, not only because many complicated real-world big data, such as social data, financial data, transportation data, crime data, biological data, etc., can be modeled as graphs, but also because the graph analytics can reveal underlying patterns in these data from the perspective of relationship or topology. In this tutorial, I will review the recent work of my group in both academic research and industrial application, including&nbsp;geo-social network analytics, diversified service composition based on graphs, attributed network embedding, and financial graph analytics.</p>



<p><strong>Biography:&nbsp;</strong>Dr. Ming Zhong is currently an associate professor at School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, and is the deputy director of Hubei Provincial Engineering Research Center in Public Finance and&nbsp;Economy&nbsp;Big Data. He received his PhD and BD in Computer Science from Wuhan University, and worked at New York State University at Stony Brook, USA and Carleton University, Canada as visiting research fellow. His research interests include big data analytics, graph analytics,&nbsp;fintech, etc. He published over thirty research papers&nbsp;of&nbsp;the related topics, and was funded by NSFC, NSF of Hubei Province, Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Higher-order community detection has gained an increasing amount of attention in the past few years. In this tutorial, we will first introduce the definition of higher-order community detection, the existing approaches, and the advantages compared with the lower-order community detection approaches. Then, we will introduce some recent approaches for higher-order community detection, including the edge enhancement approach for overcoming the hypergraph fragmentation issue, and the harmonic motif modularity approach for multi-layer network community detection. Finally, we will briefly make a discussion on the challenges to be addressed in the future work.</p>
