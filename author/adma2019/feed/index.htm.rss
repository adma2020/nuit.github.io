<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Feature engineering is one of the most important parts of machine learning task. As a most universal format of data existence, such as social network, information network etc, information networks have been widely studied within a broad scope of machine learning. Network Representation Learning (NRL) aims to project network nodes (or other entities) into a low-dimensional vector space while preserving general proximity between nodes, and has become a hot topic in data mining and machine learning. In this talk, I will first overview the basic concepts of NRL, and give an introduction about our recent advancements in such field, such as tag embedding, domain adaptive network embedding, and landmark based network embedding etc.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>



<p>With the fast development of various positioning techniques such as Global Position System (GPS), mobile devices and remote sensing, spatio-temporal data generated in urban areas has become increasingly available nowadays. Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important for better design of smart city applications, such as human mobility monitoring, smart transportation, urban planning, public safety, and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution of spatio-temporal datasets increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics-based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed. Recently, with the great success of AI techniques, especially deep learning methods, various AI techniques have been widely applied in analyzing rich spatio-temporal data generated in urban areas. In this tutorial, I will present our recent research on AI empowered spatio-temporal data mining. First, I will introduce the new challenges and opportunities of applying AI techniques to address various spatio-temporal data mining tasks in general. Then I will summarize a general framework to show the pipeline of AI empowered spatio-temporal data mining, followed by several examples illustrating how AI techniques including both shallow models and deep learning models can be utilized in the applications of demand-supply prediction in on-demand services, urban traffic prediction and urban crowd flow prediction. Finally, I will conclude the limitations of current research and point out future research directions.</p>



<p><strong>About the speaker:</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Senzhang Wang is currently an associate professor at College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and also a “Hong Kong Scholar” Postdoc Fellow at Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. His main research focus is on spatio-temporal data mining, social computing, graph mining and smart city. He has published more than 60 papers in premier conferences and journals of related areas such as KDD, TKDE, ICDM, SDM, AAAI, IJCAI, CIKM, TOIS, KAIS, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;To achieve satisfying classification performance, traditional machine learning (TML) usually assumes that there are abundant labeled data with i.i.d. distribution to train a good model. However, there always lacks of labeled data and are expensive to annotate data, thus TML may fail. Fortunately, there may exist large amount of labeled data from related source domains but with different distributions. Along this line, Transfer Learning (TL) is proposed to adapt the knowledge from related domain to improving the performance in target domains. In this talk, I will overview the concepts of transfer learning, and recent studies of transfer learning. Then, I will introduce our efforts made on the research on transfer learning algorithms. Finally, some possible future research directions are pointed out.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;Graph analytics, especially for the big graphs with billions of nodes and edges, is an exciting new area for big data analytics workloads. It has drawn enormous research interests, not only because many complicated real-world big data, such as social data, financial data, transportation data, crime data, biological data, etc., can be modeled as graphs, but also because the graph analytics can reveal underlying patterns in these data from the perspective of relationship or topology. In this tutorial, I will review the recent work of my group in both academic research and industrial application, including&nbsp;geo-social network analytics, diversified service composition based on graphs, attributed network embedding, and financial graph analytics.</p>

<p>Human beings are moving from the IT era to the DT (data technology) era in which data is the most valuable resource. In terms of Big Data computing, the mainstream computing systems of Big Data represented by Hadoop, Spark and Flink have different programming models and interfaces, which focus on batch or stream tasks respectively. With the development of mobile internet, the traditional cloud computing model has been unable to effectively promote the development of new applications such as smart homes and smart cities. Therefore, mixed batch &amp; stream processing, cross-domain deployments and edge computing will be the development and research trends of the future big data computing.<br>In this talk, we will first review the traditional big data computing platforms, and introduce their development history, characteristics, advantages and core issues. We then will analyze the challenges and difficulties faced by the traditional cloud computing models from the aspects of batch &amp; stream interactive computing, cross-data center computing and mobile edge computing. We finally propose the development and research trends for future data computing under the era of Big Data 2.0.<gwmw style="display:none;"></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>In healthcare
domains, large-scale heterogeneous types of data like medical images, vital signs,
electronic health records (EHR), genome, etc., have been collected constantly,
forming the valuable big health data. Broad and deep mining/learning of these big heterogeneous biomedical
data can enable innovative Medical AI applications with rich research lines/challenges
underlying. In this talk, I will introduce recent developments and ongoing
projects on the above topic, especially in intelligent diagnostic decision
support and disease early detection by using various advanced data mining/deep
learning techniques including image analysis (for medical images), multivariate
time-series analysis (for vital signs like ECG/EEG), patterns mining (for EHR),
text mining (for medical notes), sensory analysis (for sensory data like air
pollutants) as well as data fusion methods for integrated modeling. Some
innovative applications on Medical AI with breakthrough results based on the
developed techniques, as well as the underlying challenging issues and open
opportunities, will also be addressed.</p>
